                <p>
                  I chose to reflect on my experience with Exam 3, which focused
                  on more applications of derivatives and the basics of
                  integrals. I started studying about a week before the test
                  because I wanted to give myself enough time to go over
                  everything. I reviewed class notes, past quizzes, and homework
                  assignments to refresh the main concepts. I focused especially
                  on the areas I wasn’t super confident in. Two days before the
                  exam, I went to the Math Lab and got some help with questions
                  I was stuck on, which helped clear up some confusion. Most of
                  my studying was done alone, but I tried to actively work
                  through problems instead of just re-reading my notes. At the
                  time, I really thought I was preparing the right way. I felt
                  like I had a decent understanding, so I didn’t expect the
                  integrals to completely throw me off—but they did. When I got
                  to those problems, it was like my brain shut down, and I
                  didn’t know how to approach them at all. <br />
                  I got my exam grade and saw that I failed, I felt really
                  disappointed in myself. I didn’t expect to do that badly, and
                  it made me realize that I needed to study more deeply and give
                  myself more time with the harder concepts—especially
                  integrals. I looked back through the test to figure out where
                  I went wrong and noticed that the types of problems I avoided
                  or didn’t practice enough were the ones I struggled with the
                  most. I also talked to a tutor to go over my mistakes and make
                  sure I understood the correct steps. This helped a lot and
                  gave me a clearer idea of what to focus on next time. I want
                  to take this as a learning experience and not let it
                  discourage me. For the next exam, I plan to start even
                  earlier, do more practice with tricky problems, and test
                  myself more often so I feel more confident and prepared.
