              <div class="education-item-1">
                <p>
                  I chose to reflect on my experience with Exam 3, which focused
                  on more applications of derivatives and the basics of
                  integrals. I started studying about a week before the test
                  because I wanted to give myself enough time to go over
                  everything. I reviewed class notes, past quizzes, and homework
                  assignments to refresh the main concepts. I focused especially
                  on the areas I wasn’t super confident in. Two days before the
                  exam, I went to the Math Lab and got some help with questions
                  I was stuck on, which helped clear up some confusion. Most of
                  my studying was done alone, but I tried to actively work
                  through problems instead of just re-reading my notes. At the
                  time, I really thought I was preparing the right way. I felt
                  like I had a decent understanding, so I didn’t expect the
                  integrals to completely throw me off—but they did. When I got
                  to those problems, it was like my brain shut down, and I
                  didn’t know how to approach them at all. <br />
                  I got my exam grade and saw that I failed, I felt really
                  disappointed in myself. I didn’t expect to do that badly, and
                  it made me realize that I needed to study more deeply and give
                  myself more time with the harder concepts—especially
                  integrals. I looked back through the test to figure out where
                  I went wrong and noticed that the types of problems I avoided
                  or didn’t practice enough were the ones I struggled with the
                  most. I also talked to a tutor to go over my mistakes and make
                  sure I understood the correct steps. This helped a lot and
                  gave me a clearer idea of what to focus on next time. I want
                  to take this as a learning experience and not let it
                  discourage me. For the next exam, I plan to start even
                  earlier, do more practice with tricky problems, and test
                  myself more often so I feel more confident and prepared.

              Functions of Two Variables (Sections 4.1–4.3)
              Free Online Resources:

                  1    Paul's Online Math Notes – Functions of Several Variables
              https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/multivrblefcns.aspx
              Pros: Offers detailed, step-by-step explanations with comprehensive examples, covering domains, graphs, and level curves.
              Cons: The text-heavy format might be overwhelming for visual learners seeking interactive content.

                  2    Khan Academy – Multivariable Functions 
              https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/thinking-about-multivariable-function/introduction-to-multivariable-calculus/v/multivariable-functions 
              Pros: Provides engaging video lessons that introduce concepts clearly, making it accessible for beginners.
              Cons: The pace might be too slow for those looking for a quick review or more advanced material.
              
                  3    Desmos – 3D Graphing Calculator
              https://www.desmos.com/3d 
              Pros: An interactive tool that allows users to visualize 3D graphs and level curves, aiding in understanding the behavior of functions.
              Cons: Lacks explanatory content; best used as a supplementary visual aid alongside other resources.
              
                  4    MIT OpenCourseWare – Multivariable Calculus Lecture Notes
              https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/pages/lecture-notes/ 
              Pros: Provides in-depth lecture notes and practice problems from a prestigious institution, offering a rigorous academic perspective.
              Cons: The advanced level and depth may be challenging for beginners without prior exposure to the subject.
              
                  5    Math Insight – Introduction to Multivariable Functions
              https://mathinsight.org/multivariable_function_introduction 
              Pros: Features written explanations and interactive illustrations that are beginner-friendly, helping to build foundational understanding.
              Cons: Does not include practice problems, focusing more on conceptual explanations than application.
              
              Reflection Paragraph:
              These resources collectively provide a comprehensive toolkit for exploring functions of two variables. Paul's Online Math Notes are invaluable for students who appreciate detailed, methodical explanations, though the dense text may not cater to all learning styles. Khan Academy's video lessons offer a more conversational and accessible approach, ideal for those new to the topic, but might progress too slowly for advanced learners. Desmos serves as an excellent visual aid, allowing for dynamic interaction with 3D graphs and level curves, yet it doesn't delve into the underlying mathematical concepts. MIT OpenCourseWare delivers a deep dive into the subject matter, suitable for those seeking a rigorous academic challenge, but it may be daunting for novices. Lastly, Math Insight provides clear, interactive explanations that simplify complex ideas, although it lacks accompanying practice exercises. By integrating these diverse resources, learners can benefit from multiple perspectives and methods, enhancing their overall comprehension ofthe functions of two variables.
